# My RtD Toolkit

In the world of design I have seen many things and created a network around me of various tools that can help during the design and research process. Yet while starting this masters and moving to Barcelona this has shifted me away from some things I know and also opened me up to new possibilities. That is why my toolkit at the moment is shown in the image below but I feel it will grow as the year progresses.
